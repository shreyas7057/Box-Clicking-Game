# Box Clicking Game

Game is created using C++ Game Library SFML.
In this game rectangle shaped box are created in random size at random positon. We have to click on that box to gain the health.
If we miss the box then our health decreaments and once health reached at 0 game stops and window gets closed. 
On Clicking on boxes our points are increased and game runs till health is 0. 


I have used Visual Studio Code to create game so to run in this editor following commands can be used:
1) make
2) bin/main
